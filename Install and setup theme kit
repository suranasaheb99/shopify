The steps may get changed and updated, so please follow the latest steps.

Here are the steps as of April 2023 for windows
Firstly, you have to install chocolatey. To install chocolatey, visit https://chocolatey.org/ and go for install. Parallely open windows powershell under administrative
mode. Paste the command which you find on chocolatey browser : Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
This will install a chocolatey to your system. To verify, run 'choco -v' command in cmd

Secondly, you have to install a theme kit. To do that, in same powershell, give command 'choco install themekit', this will install a theme kit to your system. 
NOTE: While installing a theme kit, it might ask you for a permision, you have to select Y for it.
