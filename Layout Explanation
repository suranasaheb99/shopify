What is layout in shopify?

In Shopify, a layout refers to the overall design and structure of a web page.
It includes the placement and arrangement of various elements such as the header, footer, navigation menu, content areas, and product listings.
Layouts are the base of the theme, through which all templates are rendered.
Layouts are Liquid files that allow you to include content, that should be repeated on multiple page types, in a single location.

Basic head content and body content under layout file
<head>
  <title> {{ page_title }} </title>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1">
  <meta name="description" content="{{ page_description | escape }}">
  <link rel="canonical" href="{{ canonical_url }}">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no">
  {{ content_for_header }} <!-- Header hook for plugins -->
  {{ 'application.scss.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}
  {{ 'application.js' | asset_url | script_tag }}
</head>
<body>
  <main role="main">
    {{ content_for_layout }}
  </main>
</body>

The purpose of using the meta keywords will helps search engines to understand the relevant topics and keywords of the page.

If we want to link the webpage to stylesheet, will use the format : {{ 'application.scss.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}

Adding scripts: This is used to add functionality and interactivity to the page, such as tracking analytics, social media sharing, or user interactions.
{{ 'application.js' | asset_url | script_tag }}

CONTENT
 - content_for_header
 - content_for_index
 - content_for_layout
 
 These objects are required in theme.liquid.
 If references to these objects aren't included, then you can't save or update the file using the code editor or tools like Shopify CLI.
 
"content_for_header"
The content_for_header object is required in theme.liquid.
It must be placed inside the HTML <head> tag.
It dynamically loads all scripts required by Shopify into the document head.
These scripts are required for features like reCAPTCHA, Shopify apps, and more.
You shouldn't try to modify or parse the content_for_header object. If content_for_header changes, then the behavior of your Liquid will change.

"content_for_layout"
The content_for_layout object dynamically outputs the content for each template.
You need to add a reference to this object between the <body> and </body> HTML tags.
